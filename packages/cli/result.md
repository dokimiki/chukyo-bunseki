These are likely separate applications or modules within the overall system.\n*   `/class/publics/`: Navigates to a page showing public classes.\n*   The page uses AJAX calls to:\n    *   `glexa_help`: Loads the manual content (likely HTML) into the modal.\n    *   `addon_tsup_link`: Checks if the teaching profession support link should be displayed.\n    *   `addon_links_modal_view`: Loads the content for the Links Collection modal.\n    *   `glexa_ajax_access_accept`: Keeps the session alive.\n\n**Automation and Testing Considerations:**\n\n*   **Functional Testing:**\n    *   Verify that all navigation links are functional and redirect to the correct pages.\n    *   Test language switching functionality thoroughly.\n    *   Validate the content and functionality of the help modal.\n    *   Ensure that the class list displays the correct courses for the logged-in user.\n    *   Verify that the timetable updates correctly when switching between semesters.\n    *   Test the logout functionality.\n*   **UI Testing:**\n    *   Verify the responsive design of the page on different screen sizes.\n    *   Ensure that all UI elements are displayed correctly and are visually appealing.\n    *   Validate that the page conforms to accessibility standards.\n*   **Performance Testing:**\n    *   Measure the page load time and identify any performance bottlenecks.\n    *   Optimize the page for faster loading.\n*   **End-to-End Testing:**\n    *   Simulate user workflows from login to accessing various features.\n*   **Selectors:** Use the provided CSS selectors for robust UI automation. Avoid relying on text-based selectors, which can be fragile.\n\n**Page-Specific Business Logic and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Authentication:**  The page requires a user to be authenticated.\n*   **Authorization:** The content displayed (e.g., class list, timetable) depends on the user's role and enrolled courses.\n*   **Session Management:** The page uses session management to maintain the user's login state.\n*   **Language Preference:** The system should remember the user's language preference across sessions.\n*   **Add-on Availability:**  The availability of certain add-ons (e.g., 教職支援) might depend on user roles or university policies.\n*   **Timetable Data:** The timetable data is fetched dynamically from a database or API.  The data should be accurate and up-to-date.\n*   **Email Badge:** The number displayed in the email badge should accurately reflect the number of unread emails in the user's inbox.  Ensure this is updated in real-time or near real-time.\n"

Use these selectors to target specific elements on the page.\n*   **Data Setup:**  Tests should be designed to work with a consistent set of test data (emails).  This data should be created and managed in a way that ensures the tests are repeatable and reliable.\n*   **Test Data Management:** Develop a strategy for creating and managing test emails. This might involve creating test accounts and sending emails between them.\n\n**Page-Specific Business Logic and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Email Deletion:**  The user should only be able to delete emails that they have permission to delete (i.e., their own emails).\n*   **Email Marking as Read:** Marking an email as read should persist across sessions.\n*   **Search Functionality:** The search functionality should be able to search across multiple fields (e.g., sender, subject, body).\n*   **Pagination:**  The pagination should be implemented correctly to handle a large number of emails.\n*   **Security:** Ensure proper authorization and authentication mechanisms are in place to protect user emails.\n*   **Session Management:** The page relies on session management. Verify that the session timeout is handled gracefully and that users are redirected to the login page when the session expires.\n*   **Privacy Alert:** The download functionality has a privacy alert. Ensure that the download is triggered after the user confirms the alert.\n*   **Mail Count Badge:** The number in the `span.badge` is updated after email is read or deleted.

(Requires more information about the action triggered by the link).\n\n4.  **Sending Email to the Teacher:**\n    *   Clicking the "教員にメールを送る" (Send Email to Teacher) link opens a modal or navigates to a page where the user can compose an email to the instructor.\n\n5.  **Directory Management (Potentially Teacher Only):**\n    *   The directory list (`#div-class-directories`) appears to have functionality for sorting, moving, and editing directories. These features may be restricted to teachers.\n    *   Clicking the folder icons (`.glyphicon-folder-toggle`) expands or collapses the directory tree.\n\n6.  **Content Loading:**\n    *   The contents of the `#div-class-contents` area are dynamically loaded based on the selected directory and potentially other filters.\n\n**API Endpoints and Data Flows:**\n\nBased on the JavaScript code, the following API endpoints are likely used:\n\n*   `/logout/`: Logs the user out.\n*   `/addon/tsup`: Navigates to the addon tsup.\n*   `/addon/syllabus`: Navigates to the addon syllabus.\n*   `/addon/fdcheck`: Navigates to the addon fdcheck.\n*   `/class/grade/85131/`: Fetches the user's grades for the course.\n*   `glexa_ajax_access_accept`: Used for session management and potentially tracking user access.\n*   `glexa_help`: Fetches help manual content.\n*   `glexa_modal_entry_form`: Used for displaying class entry modal.\n*   `glexa_modal_clicker_form`: Used for displaying clicker modal.\n*   `teacher_ajax_class_directory_list_move_accept`: Used when moving directories in the directory list (likely teacher only).\n*   `addon_survey_common_alert`: Fetches the number of unanswered survey questions.\n*   `addon_links_modal_view`: Fetches data for the links collection modal.\n*   `teacher_modal_class_content_form`: Opens content form modal.\n*   `teacher_modal_class_resource_form`: Opens resource form modal.\n*   `addon_msteams_teacher_modal_class_form`: Opens msteams form modal.\n*   `teacher_modal_class_entry_form`: Opens entry form modal.\n*   `teacher_modal_clicker_form`: Opens clicker form modal.\n\nData flows primarily involve fetching data from these endpoints and rendering it in the appropriate UI elements, particularly `#div-class-contents` and `#div-class-directories`.\n\n**Automation and Testing Considerations:**\n\n1.  **Automated UI Tests:**\n    *   Verify that all navigation links are functional and redirect to the correct pages.\n    *   Test the functionality of the class menu and submenu.\n    *   Verify that the contents area (`#div-class-contents`) is updated correctly when a directory is selected.\n    *   Test the email sending functionality (if applicable).\n    *   Automate directory management operations (if accessible to the test user).\n    *   Test for broken links and ensure proper error handling.\n\n2.  **API Tests:**\n    *   Test all API endpoints to ensure they return the expected data and handle errors gracefully.\n    *   Verify that the correct data is displayed in the UI based on the API responses.\n    *   Test for proper authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n3.  **Performance Tests:**\n    *   Measure the page load time and ensure it meets performance requirements.\n    *   Test the performance of API calls and identify any bottlenecks.\n\n4.  **Accessibility Tests:**\n    *   Ensure that the page is accessible to users with disabilities.\n    *   Verify that the page meets WCAG guidelines.\n\n5.  **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**\n    *   Test the page in different browsers to ensure it renders correctly and functions as expected.\n\n**Page-Specific Business Logic and Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Session Management:**\n    *   The page relies heavily on session management to maintain user state and prevent unauthorized access.\n    *   Session timeout should be handled gracefully, redirecting the user to the login page.\n\n2.  **Directory Permissions:**\n    *   Directory management operations may be restricted to teachers.\n    *   The UI should reflect the user's permissions, disabling or hiding features that are not accessible.\n\n3.  **Dynamic Content Loading:**\n    *   The contents area (`#div-class-contents`) is dynamically loaded, which can make testing more challenging.\n    *   Test cases should account for different content types and scenarios.\n\n4.  **Addons:**\n    *   The page integrates with various addons, such as Syllabus and Questionnaire.\n    *   Test cases should verify that these addons are functioning correctly and that data is being passed between the page and the addons.\n\n5.  **Language Support:**\n    *   The page supports multiple languages.\n    *   Test cases should verify that the page is properly localized and that the correct language is displayed based on the user's preferences.\n\n6.  **Mobile Responsiveness:**\n    *   The page is designed to be responsive and should adapt to different screen sizes.\n    *   Test cases should verify that the page renders correctly on different devices.\n\n7.  **Class Entry/Clicker Modals:**\n    *   There is logic to open modals for class entry or clicker functionality based on AJAX calls.\n    *   The logic should be tested to ensure that the modals only open under the correct conditions.\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the \"Algorithms and Data Structures 2 (Thursday/1st period)\" course page within the CHUKYO MaNaBo portal. It includes details on UI elements, user interactions, API endpoints, testing considerations, and page-specific business logic, which can be used by development, automation, and testing teams to ensure the quality and functionality of the page."

This opens a modal using `glexa.openModalMailForm`. This allows the student to send an email.\n\n**API Endpoints and Data Flows:**\n\n*   `glexa_ajax_access_accept`:  Used for session management and potentially tracking user activity (called periodically).\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_view_image_accept`: Handles profile image uploads and deletions.  Parameters: `member_id`, `is_remove` (boolean).  Data returned triggers a full MyPage reload.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_note_view`: Loads notes, requires `member_id` and `class_id` parameters.  Content is loaded into `#div-mypage-tab`.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_file_list`: Loads the file list. Parameters: `member_id`, `class_id` (optional), `q` (search query), `p` (page number).  Content is loaded into `#div-mypage-tab`.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_content_list`: Loads the activity list. Parameters: `member_id`, `class_id` (optional), `q` (search query), `p` (page number). Content is loaded into `#div-mypage-tab`.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_usage_view`: Loads usage information.  Parameters: `member_id`, `class_id` (optional). Content is loaded into `#div-mypage-tab`.\n*   `addon_tsup_link`:  Used to conditionally show the "教職支援" link.  Returns data that determines if the link should be displayed.\n\n**Automation and Testing Considerations:**\n\n*   **End-to-End Tests:**\n    *   Verify that a logged-in user is redirected to their My Page.\n    *   Verify that navigation links in the header and sidebar function correctly.\n    *   Test the profile image upload and deletion workflows.\n    *   Test navigation between classes in the sidebar and the corresponding content in the main area.\n    *   Test tab navigation and content loading.\n*   **UI Tests:**\n    *   Verify the presence and correct state of UI elements (links, buttons, images).\n    *   Verify that error messages are displayed correctly for invalid actions (e.g., invalid file uploads).\n    *   Verify that AJAX loading indicators are displayed during data retrieval.\n*   **API Tests:**\n    *   Test the `glexa_ajax_mypage_*` API endpoints with different parameters to ensure they return the correct data.\n    *   Test error handling for invalid API requests.\n*   **Accessibility Tests:**\n    *   Ensure that the page is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation).\n*   **Automation Notes:**\n    *   Use CSS selectors to locate and interact with UI elements.\n    *   Handle AJAX calls and asynchronous loading of content.\n    *   Use appropriate wait strategies to ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them.\n    *   Be aware of potential session management issues and handle them accordingly.\n\n**Page-Specific Business Logic and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The page requires the user to be authenticated.\n*   **Authorization:** Access to certain features or data may be restricted based on the user's role or permissions.\n*   **Profile Image:** There might be constraints on the size and type of profile images that can be uploaded.\n*   **Class Data:** The list of classes displayed in the sidebar is dynamically generated based on the user's enrollment.\n*   **Session Management:** The `glexa_ajax_access_accept` call and the `sessionErrorMessage` variable suggest a session timeout mechanism. Tests should verify proper handling of session timeouts and invalid sessions.\n*   **Addons:** The presence of addons like "教職支援" and "シラバス" indicates that the page is extensible.  Tests should verify the integration of these addons.\n*   **Responsive Design:** The meta tag `meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale = 1.0, maximum-scale = 4.0, user-scalable=yes\"` indicates a responsive design. Tests should verify that the page renders correctly on different screen sizes and devices.

  "markdown": "### 松田　直旺 マイページ | CHUKYO MaNaBo (OTHER)\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nThis page is the student's (松田　直旺) personalized dashboard within the CHUKYO MaNaBo learning management system. It provides a central location for viewing profile information, accessing enrolled classes, and navigating to various functionalities such as mail, settings, usage guides, syllabi, and surveys.  The primary functions are information display and navigation to other areas of the system. The `activity` anchor link, which is the focus of this analysis, leads to a list of course activities.\n\n**Key UI Elements:**\n\n| Element | Selector | Purpose |\n|---|---|---| \n| Logout Link | `a[href=\"/logout/\"]` | Allows the user to log out of the system. |\n| Top Link | `a[href=\"/\"]` | Navigates the user to the top page of the system. |\n| My Page Link | `a[href=\"/mypage/\"]` | Navigates the user to the user's mypage. |\n| Mail Link | `a[href=\"/mails/\"]` | Navigates the user to the mail section. Displays the number of unread emails. |\n| Settings Link | `a[href=\"/profile/\"]` | Navigates the user to the settings page. |\n| Usage Link | `a[href=\"#\"]` | Opens a modal containing usage guides. |\n| Kyoshoku Support Link | `a[href=\"/addon/tsup\"]` | Navigates the user to the Teacher Support addon page. |\n| Syllabus Link | `a[href=\"/addon/syllabus\"]` | Navigates the user to the Syllabus addon page. |\n| Survey Link | `a[href=\"/addon/fdcheck\"]` | Navigates the user to the Survey addon page. |\n| Link Collection | `a[href=\"#\"]` | Navigates the user to the link collection page. |\n| Student Mode | `a[href=\"#\"]` | Navigates the user to the student page. |\n| Profile Image | `.a-member-thumbnail img` | Displays the user's profile image. |\n| Profile Image Uploader | `#div-mypage-uploader` | Allows the user to upload a new profile image. |\n| Class List | `.classes-student-view a.a-mypage-class` | Lists the classes the student is enrolled in.  Clicking a class navigates to the class's page with the `activity` anchor. |\n| All Classes Label | `.list-group > label > b` | Displays the \"All\" classes label. |\n| Profile Information | `T324076&nbsp;松田　直旺&nbsp;さん` | Displays the user profile information including the student id and name. |\n\n**User Interactions and Workflows:**\n\n1.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Clicking any of the navigation links (`Top`, `My Page`, `Mail`, `Settings`, `Usage`, `Kyoshoku Support`, `Syllabus`, `Survey`, `Link Collection`) redirects the user to the corresponding page.  The `Mail` link also displays an unread mail count.\n    *   Clicking a class in the `Class List` redirects the user to the class's page, specifically to the `activity` section (e.g., `/mypage/47234/85120/#activity`).\n    *   Clicking the `Usage` link opens a modal window containing links to student manuals and addon guides.\n\n2.  **Profile Image Management:**\n    *   The user can upload a new profile image using the `#div-mypage-uploader` element.  The `dropzone` library is used for file uploads.\n    *   After a successful upload, the profile image is updated.  An AJAX call to `glexa_ajax_mypage_view_image_accept` is made to process the image.\n\n3.  **Logout:**\n    *   Clicking the `Logout` link triggers a confirmation dialog.  Upon confirmation, the user is logged out and redirected to the login page.\n\n4.  **Sending Mail:**\n    *   Clicking the `Mail` link below the profile picture opens a modal form to send an email.\n\n**API Endpoints and Data Flows:**\n\n*   `glexa_ajax_access_accept`:  (Called periodically) Checks for session validity and performs actions based on the response.\n*   `glexa_help`:  Fetches help/manual content to populate the `Usage` modal.\n*   `glexa_modal_entry_form`:  Used in relation to class entry (not directly on this page, but potentially triggered from linked pages).  Checks if the user needs to enter a class.\n*   `glexa_modal_clicker_form`: Used in relation to clicker functions (not directly on this page, but potentially triggered from linked pages).\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_view_image_accept`: Handles the image upload and removal actions for the profile image.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_note_view`: Fetches notes for a specific class.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_file_list`: Fetches the user's file list, potentially filtered by class.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_content_list`: Fetches the user's content list, potentially filtered by class. This is what loads when the `activity` anchor is used.\n*   `glexa_ajax_mypage_usage_view`: Loads usage information.\n\n**Automation and Testing Considerations:**\n\n*   **Navigation Testing:**  Verify that all navigation links redirect to the correct pages.\n*   **Profile Image Upload Testing:**\n    *   Test successful image upload and display.\n    *   Test handling of invalid file types or sizes.\n    *   Test the removal functionality.\n*   **Class List Testing:**\n    *   Verify that the class list displays correctly.\n    *   Verify that clicking a class redirects to the correct page with the `#activity` anchor.\n*   **Logout Testing:** Verify that the logout process works as expected.\n*   **UI Element Existence:** Verify that all key UI elements are present and visible.\n*   **Responsiveness:**  Check responsiveness across different screen sizes.\n\n**Page-Specific Business Logic and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Session Management:** The page relies heavily on session management.  The `sendAccess()` function is used to maintain the session.  Expired sessions should be handled gracefully.\n*   **Image Upload Constraints:** There are likely constraints on the file size and type of profile images.\n*   **Mail Badge Count:** The `Mail` link displays the number of unread emails.  This count should be updated dynamically.\n*   **Class List Display:** The class list is grouped by semester.  The display logic for these groups should be tested.\n*   **Profile Image Default:** If the user has not uploaded a profile image, the default image (`/common/images/noimage-member.jpg`) should be displayed."
